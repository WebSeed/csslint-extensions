This project contains a single additional rule (including unit tests) for CSS Lint (http://csslint.net/). This rule ensures that all CSS properties are ordered alphabetically (excluding those which are vendor-specific).

As this is a fairly project-specific requirement for CSS development I'm dumping it here.

The file locations reflect those found in the CSS Lint project.
